# dotfiles

My dotfiles

`.bash_prompt` adapted from [mathiasbynens/dotfiles][1] with these changes

- Doesn't care about git status indicators because I'm OCD and always manually review the entire diff before committing
- Doesn't care about remote vs. local hostname because 99% of the time I work remotely
- Uses 256 (8-bit) colors, thanks to [BitMote][2]
- Uses base name of current working directory
- Condenses everything into a single line with no spaces
