My dotfiles

`.bash_prompt` adapted from [mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) with these changes

- Doesn't care about git status indicators because I'm OCD and always manually review the entire diff before committing
- Doesn't care about remote vs. local hostname because 99% of the time I work remotely
- Uses 256 (8-bit) colors, thanks to [BitMote](http://bitmote.com/index.php?post/2012/11/19/Using-ANSI-Color-Codes-to-Colorize-Your-Bash-Prompt-on-Linux)
- Uses base name of current working directory
- Condenses everything into a single line with no spaces
